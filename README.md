# Blackjack Suspense Stimuli Generator

This repository contains code for generating stimuli for **Blackjack card games** with varying levels of **suspense**, adapted from the work by [Li et al. (2021)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34165041/).

The stimuli are designed to simulate different gameplay scenarios by manipulating suspense through round structure and card replacement strategies.

## üõ† How to Use
